# style
<prompt>
<task>
Apply this visual style to the user's existing project. Inspect and preserve its stack, copy, routes, and behavior. Follow existing component and styling conventions. Treat framework, library, and page examples in these design instructions as illustrations; they do not require a stack change or new sections. Scope changes to the user's requested work.

Keep controls keyboard accessible, focus visible, and text legible. Preserve reading order, responsive behavior, and reduced-motion preferences. Verify actual states at the rendered width. The user's stack and content take precedence over illustrative implementation details.

# Software

## Identity

Build an open light page with dark, tightly set sans-serif headings and a clear electric-blue action color. Pair broad reading areas with compact product diagrams, rounded white cards, and two substantial dark passages. Keep the page practical and easy to scan.

## Layout

Open with a wide text column beside a smaller product illustration. The wide layout uses roughly a 1.45:1 split. Place supporting facts in a ruled strip below when the brief provides them. Align subsequent sections to the same content width.

Let short explanations and editorial cards share a pale-grey field. A process and its supporting benefits can share one continuous dark field. Later, a pale comparison and disclosure area can lead into a dark closing and footer. Use background continuity to connect related content, adapting this sequence to the real page.

Available patterns include a three-column feature grid, equal editorial cards, numbered process steps linked across a row, and a heading beside a two-column list. Use these where the content fits. A hero diagram can show several inputs converging on a central product; use actual concepts from the brief rather than invented product screens.

## Typography

Use Host Grotesk for display, headings, quotations, and large figures. Use Instrument Sans for paragraphs, labels, and controls. Load those fonts directly; the typography fallback token alone does not select them. Keep display type bold with tight tracking and compact line-height, while reading text uses the body size and relaxed leading tokens. Give introductory text a wider measure than card descriptions. Keep labels and metadata smaller without reducing their contrast.

## Color and surfaces

Use ground for the near-white page, ground-muted for shared pale fields, and panel for white cards. Ink and ink-secondary carry primary and supporting text. Accent is the electric blue used for actions, small icons, and selected states. Dark fields use field with on-field and on-field-secondary text.

Cards have the panel radius, fine borders, and soft downward shadows. Product diagrams may use a blue center with a slight material gradient, light orbit lines, and small white tiles. Keep this dimensional treatment local; broad reading fields remain quiet.

## Components

Use blue primary buttons and pale outlined secondary buttons. Buttons have a modest corner radius, readable sans labels, and enough padding for touch. Hover lifts them slightly and changes fill; pressing returns them to their resting position. Preserve a visible focus outline.

Comparison cards can share aligned prices and feature lists. A featured card keeps its border and badge when a different option is selected; the chosen control gets the blue fill and explicit selected semantics. For questions, use native disclosures with ruled rows and a plus that rotates when opened. Include these only when the brief requires them.

## Images

Use grayscale editorial photographs in wide crops at the top of white cards, with text beneath. Reserve dimensions and keep the important subject visible. The product illustration can retain blue accents and soft depth. Avoid substituting generic photography for a useful explanation of the customer's product. Portraits are optional; text attributions work within this layout.

## Motion

Use the interaction and easing tokens for brief hover responses. Keep the hero diagram and its connecting lines still. Honor reduced motion by removing transitions and press movement. Do not add a page entrance sequence or continuous decorative animation.

## Responsive behavior

At widths around 1050px, tighten gaps while preserving the column relationships. At 760px and below, stack the hero, prose pairs, editorial cards, process steps, quotations, plans, and disclosure layout. Facts can stay in two columns, as can short feature entries. At 480px, make feature and benefit lists single-column and footer groups two-column. Keep the diagram beneath the opening copy, sized within the container, and preserve every action.

## Design limits

Keep blue attached to meaningful emphasis. Avoid turning every section into a card, adding unrelated accent colors, or filling empty space with fabricated statistics and endorsements. Choose sections from the customer's brief and retain the existing stack, routes, and behavior.
